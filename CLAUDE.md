# dromos

Pangenome graph alignments in Mojo: vg's GAM read as fast as the disk delivers it and written as the GAF lines
`vg convert -G` writes, for pgcat and pgphase (github.com/kokyriakidis/pgphase).

## Mojo skills

Modular's Mojo skills live in `.claude/skills` and correct pretrained Mojo, which is out of date. Hooks in
`.claude/settings.json` inject them: the full `mojo-syntax` skill and `references/idiomatic-mojo.md` at session
start (also after `/clear` and compaction) and into every subagent, and a reminder on every prompt
(`DROMOS_SKILLS_EVERY_PROMPT=full` injects the full text on every prompt instead). Follow them over pretrained
habits:

- `mojo-syntax` before writing, editing or reviewing any Mojo, with `references/idiomatic-mojo.md`.
- Include the skills rule in every subagent prompt.

`pixi run sync-skills` refreshes them from upstream; `.claude/skills/UPSTREAM` records the commit.

## Working here

- Build: `pixi run build` (build/dromos); test: `pixi run test`; format: `pixi run format` (120 columns).
- Toolchain: one Mojo nightly, pinned exactly in `pixi.toml` (1.2.0.dev2026102005), the one karan, sporos and plegma
  build with. Move it on purpose: change the pin, `pixi lock`, build and test.
- Build and test where the data are (a GAM, the graph's ref map and node table): `pixi run ...`.
- `gaf_line` follows libvgio's `alignment_to_gaf` (src/alignment_io.cpp) line for line; keep it so, and check any
  change against `vg convert -G` (the same lines; vg's order varies, dromos keeps the input's).
- Pointers handed to parallel tasks carry their owner's origin, or the owner is an explicit allocation that outlives
  the tasks (see sporos's CLAUDE.md for the patterns, copied here from sporos: parallel.mojo, output.mojo, bgzf.mojo).
- Finished work merges straight into `main` and is pushed; no pull requests.
